How housing conditions effect dnFGFR animals, an exploratory RNA-Seq study.

To begin understanding the gene expression changes preceeding a rescue effect in dnFGFR animals housed with same-sex partners during an experiment conducted by [Rocherster et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3532464/), an RNA-Seq experiment was performed, and differentially expressed genes were ducumented for further study. The pipeline is as follows:
